# FifaWorldCupPrediction
 The Fifa World Cup is the most watched tournament in the world and is the most popular among football lovers. I have predicted the most probable winner of the 2026 Fifa World Cup winner considering all the head to head matches played between different countries in all the World Cups held over the years since 1990. Several factors are considered like which team has the longest winning streak, which team has the best attackers,defenders and midfielders, which team has a better record in their home and away games,etc. I have used Logistic Regression model to train my model.
